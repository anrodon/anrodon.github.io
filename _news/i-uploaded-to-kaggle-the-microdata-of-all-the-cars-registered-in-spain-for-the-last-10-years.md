Yes I did.

Long time ago I noticed the existance of the Open Data portal of the spanish traffic authority ([DGTâ€Šâ€”â€ŠDirecciÃ³n General de TrÃ¡fico](https://www.dgt.es/)) called [DGT en Cifras](https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/), which allow everyone to download various data related to car registrations, drivers, fines, and other interesting topics related to the spanish car park.

I got really excited to have all that data available and played a little bit with them as you can see in my blog posts [Spainâ€™s bumpy road towards electrification](https://arodriguezdonaire.com/blog/2025/Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/) or [Predicting road accidents in Spain using Open Data](https://arodriguezdonaire.com/blog/2025/Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/), but still found the accessibility to the datasets a little bit tedious to manage due to the specifficities of the portal.

Because of this, I decided to upload to Kaggle some interesting datasets using data from [DGT en Cifras](https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/) so they will be available to be used by anyone in a fully integrated way with all the Kaggle environment, easier than ever! ðŸ˜Š

You can find the full dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anrodon/spain-car-registrations-microdata-2015-to-2024).
