I made this because it was crucial for me in this analysis to clearly detect the fatal accidents and was not that important if we had some false positives. <strong>At the end of the day, any recommendation we can give to avoid any accident will work on the right direction to safer roads.</strong></p> <p>With the identification of these factors I obtained conclusions that may help to provide measures that can prevent losses of lives.</p> <p>The data used for this project is the <a href="https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/dgt-en-cifras-resultados/dgt-en-cifras-detalle/Ficheros-microdatos-de-accidentes-con-victimas-2023/">Ficheros microdatos de accidentes con v√≠ctimas 2023 dataset</a> by the Spanish General Traffic Administration (DGT‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDirecci√≥n General de Tr√°fico). In the dataset webpage there is an excel file with the data and another one with the diccionary of the category identifiers.</p> <p>At the start of the project I took a look into the data and draw some plots that would help me understand better the dataset and obtain some draft hypothesis to work on.</p> <p>The first thing I saw is that the datset was clearly imbalanced. This was due to the fact that (luckily) most of the accidents don‚Äôt have fatal victims. <strong>In our dataset, more than 98% of the accidents didn‚Äôt have fatal victims.</strong> This fact would be a problem in order to create our model, so I created a new balanced version of the dataset selecting randomly non-fatal accidents until I had 50% of fatal and non-fatal accidents.</p> <p>With the plots previously drawn I was able to see some other interesting facts:</p> <ul> <li>Spain has a <strong>much higher fatality rate in the weekends and in holiday seasons</strong> (summer months + november and december).</li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Proportion of Fatal and Non-Fatal accidents per day of the week</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Proportion of Fatal and Non-Fatal accidents per month</figcaption> </figure> <ul> <li><strong>Fatal accidents use to happen in interurban roads</strong>.

These <strong>scores indicate how much each feature contributes to the model‚Äôs predictions</strong>.

The number of <strong>false positives also incremented</strong> but is nothing to worry about as the <strong>worst that could happen is that we recommend measures to reduce mortality in accidents that are already not mortal</strong>.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig13-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Being happy with the model, I started analysing the importance of the features in predicting fatal accidents.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig14-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>As is clearly shown in the graphic, by far the most relevant feature was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SENTIDO_1F</code> when the value was 4. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SENTIDO_1F</code> is equal to 1 it means that the vehicle was going in the direction that augments the kilometric point of the road, 2 when its in the opposite direction, 3 when both and 4 when unknown.</p> <p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SENTIDO_1F</code>is unknown is most probably because <strong>the road itself doesn‚Äôt have kilometric points</strong>. In Spain, those roads are <strong>basically urban roads and the highways, which we know for the statistical analysis that are the ones with lower fatality rates</strong>.</p> <p>This makes much sense as basically this feature indicates that the <strong>road where the accident happened should be a safe road</strong>.</p> <p>In this regard we also see in the top20 features like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inStreet</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TIPO_VIA_9</code> which clearly indicate <strong>streets</strong>.</p> <p>On the other hand we also see features like the number of vehicles taking part in the accident (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TOTAL_VEHICULOS</code>). We can explore this later.</p> <p>Other interesting findings are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONDICION_ILUMINACION_6</code> which means that there was <strong>no artificial or natural light in the accident (may lead to think about nightime)</strong> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACERA_998</code> which means that the information about the <strong>sidewalk does not apply (may lead to think about interurban roads)</strong>.</p> <p>Another repeated column in the features with most importance seems to be the accident type. Because of that, I wanted to see the feature importance of the type of accidents and type of roads.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig15-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig15-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig15-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-05-19-Predicting-road-accidents-in-Spain-using-Open-Data/fig15.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Also, we see certifications like EuroNCAP evaluating the security of vehicles against many different accidents.</li> <li><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists and motorbike riders/passengers are more likely to die in an accident than other groups on the road.</strong> There is still room to improve in working towards the security of most vulnerable road users, but we have seen already some changes in the laws to improve it.</li> </ul> <p>Luckily we can say that our administrations have in their hands already useful data to make our roads more secure, and measures are already being implement. Besides that is always good to remind that it is a collective work to try to avoid any loss of lives in the road.</p> <p>As conclusions of the project, I can say that <strong>Open Data can clearly help to improve the security of the roads</strong>. Accessible data like the one in the dataset used may help other data science enthusiasts and professionals in different industries help solve this and other problems that sadly still exist.</p> <p>Personally this project has been a great experience to learn more about classification models and its optimisation, and also to learn more about the road accidents that sadly still kill too many people in Spain.</p> <p>All the code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/anrodon/predicting-road-accidents-in-spain">Github</a> profile.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="data-science"/><category term="cars"/><category term="cars"/><category term="Spain"/><category term="data"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How Open Data can help to improve the security of our roads]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Spain‚Äôs bumpy road towards electrification</title><link href="https://anrodon.github.io/blog/2025/Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spain‚Äôs bumpy road towards electrification"/><published>2025-04-07T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-07T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anrodon.github.io/blog/2025/Spain&apos;s-bumpy-road-towards-electrification</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anrodon.github.io/blog/2025/Spain&apos;s-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/"><![CDATA[<figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/car-traffic-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/car-traffic-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/car-traffic-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/car-traffic.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>The automotive industry is undergoing one of the most significant transformation periods in its history. New propulsion systems, regulations, consumer demands, and other factors are challenging the status quo of this century-old industry.</p> <p>According to the European Commission, <strong>passenger cars are responsible for around 16% of the total CO2 emissions in Europe</strong>, and because of that, the European administration has set <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/transport/road-transport-reducing-co2-emissions-vehicles/co2-emission-performance-standards-cars-and-vans_en">fleet-wide CO2 emission targets</a> to contribute to reaching at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990 as well as achieving climate neutrality by 2050, in line with the <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-climate-law_en">European Climate Law</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spain is the second largest passenger car producer in Europe</strong> (behind Germany) and the automotive industry generates approximately the 7% of the Spanish GDP. But Spain is not only a major automobile producer; it is also a significant consumer market for cars, with <strong>yearly registration figures close to 1 million vehicles</strong>.</p> <p>The Spanish General Traffic Administration (<a href="https://www.dgt.es/">DGT‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDirecci√≥n General de Tr√°fico</a>) has an Open Data portal called <a href="https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/">DGT en Cifras</a>, which allow everyone to download various data related to car registrations, drivers, fines, and other interesting topics related to the spanish car park.</p> <p>I was curious about analyzing one of its datasets storing microdata of the registered cars for each month (<a href="https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/dgt-en-cifras-resultados/dgt-en-cifras-detalle/Microdatos-de-parque-de-vehiculos-anual/">Microdatos de Matriculaciones de Veh√≠culos (mensual)</a>) and the results of this analysis show a really sad reality: <strong>the spanish market is not choosing to purchase zero-emissions vehicles</strong>.</p> <p>Before starting to work with the data, I wrote four questions to guide my analysis:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Are the Spanish costumers purchasing electrified vehicles?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which Spanish provinces have the biggest and smallest number of electrified vehicles registrations?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which Spanish provinces are registering more and fewer polluting vehicles?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which car brands are selling more and fewer ecological cars in Spain?</strong></li> </ol> <p>These questions were written with the aim of assessing if the spanish car consumers are taking or not into account the CO2 emissions when purchasing a new car. Because of that, we only took into account new passenger cars from the dataset (we did not include commercial vehicles, vans, industrial machinery, etc and neither used cars being registered again).</p> <p><strong>The data used has been from March 2024 to February 2025 (last 12 available months of data).</strong></p> <p>In regards of the first question the situation is the following:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Even though <strong>HEV cars</strong> (Hybrid Electric Vehicles‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägas cars with electric motor support) <strong>are the ones being registered the most</strong>, <strong>PHEV</strong> (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) <strong>and BEV</strong> (Battery Electric Vehicles) <strong>together account for only 11.3% of the registrations, with only 6.1% being fully electric</strong>. This indicates that Spain still has a long way to go to reach zero-emission registrations.</p> <p>With the second question, <strong>‚ÄúWhich Spanish provinces have the highest and lowest number of electrified vehicle registrations?‚Äù</strong>, I tried to delve deeper into the dataset.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>With the graphic above, I saw that the capital <strong>Madrid is the clear winner in terms of zero-emissions vehicle registrations</strong>, followed by big cities like Barcelona or Valencia.

We see that <strong>most of the PHEV and BEV cars registered by companies in Madrid are for Renting</strong> (probably because most of the banks and renting companies in Spain are registered in Madrid), so <strong>close to half of the PHEV and BEV cars registered in Madrid are probably to be driven by renting customers in other areas of Spain</strong>.</p> <p>So, we have an answer for our second question as we know that <strong>Madrid is the province registering more electrified cars, but the customer behind the wheel may not be driving it in the capital</strong>.</p> <p>To complement this half answered question, I made a ratio of cars per habitant of each of the top 5 provinces registering more PHEV and BEV only by natural persons.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Top 5 provinces with more PHEV + BEV car registrations by natural persons</figcaption> </figure> <p>We can see that <strong>Madrid and Valencia are the leaders in terms of electrified vehicles per capita</strong> and Barcelona, Alicante and Malaga have similar numbers but are a slightly behind. Would be interesting to analize what is driving this behaviour in Madrid and Valencia to be able to implement measures to improve the rates in the other provinces.</p> <p>To answer the third question, ‚Äú<strong>Which spanish provinces are registering more and less polluting vehicles?‚Äù</strong>, I used the field in the dataset that indicates the g Co2/km of each car to have an average for each province.</p> <p>Doing a quick average between all the cars registered, I found that <strong>the average of CO2 emissions for cars registered in Spain for the last 12 months have been 123,09 g Co2/km</strong>.</p> <p><strong>This number is really alarming as the EU Commission target was 95 g Co2/km for 2024 and is 93,6 g Co2/km for 2025 to 2029.</strong></p> <p>To get a bit of feeling of how bad the situation is, I wanted to see the average CO2 emissions of the top 15 sold models.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Top 15 car models by volume (BASTIDOR_ITV) with its average CO2 emmissions</figcaption> </figure> <p>We see that <strong>for the 15 models with more registrations in the last 12 months, only the TOYOTA C-HR has an average g CO2 /km value inside the EU Comission Targets.</strong></p> <p>Now focusing on the provinces, I took the company registered vehicles apart from the analysis to not contaminate the big picture, and printed the average emissions by province.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Bad news again. <strong>Not even one of the provinces in Spain is achieving the average emission targets of the EU Commission for the new cars registered</strong>, but the accumulated fleet-wide average will be worse!</p> <p>Let‚Äôs see it even more graphically:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>In the map above, <strong>the scale is set so all the provinces below the EU Commission targets should be shown in white, and more red as they pass the 95 g CO2/km figure</strong>.

Only the fourth question is left: <strong>Which car brands are selling more and less ecological cars in Spain?</strong></p> <p>It is kind of obvious that the companies selling 100% BEVs are the ones selling the more ecological cars, but let‚Äôs see them ordered by volumes:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig12-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig12-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig12-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>What we see basically is that <strong>TESLA and BYD are the two brands leading the pack of companies with 100% electrified sales</strong>.</p> <p>But as we have seen, PHEV and BEV car registrations amount for a bit more than 10% of the market. Let‚Äôs see what happens with all the other cars. For my last graphic, I wanted to focus just on those brands who register more than 1.000 cars in the last 12 months in Spain.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig13-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><strong>From all the brands selling more than 1.000 cars in the last 12 months, only TESLA, BYD and MINI are registering an average of g CO2/km below the EU Comission Targets.</strong></p> <p>In my opinion, this is not something that the other brands are happy about. Most of them share proudly the vision of a future for the automotive industry with only zero-emissions vehicles, have invested lots of money into developing this kind of cars and spend a lot into advertising of their electric models.</p> <p><strong>What this analysis shows is that the market in Spain is not choosing the electromobility options that the brands offer, and this is something that the spanish administrations should be really worried about.</strong></p> <p><strong>It is urgent that the spanish market has the right incentives to buy zero-emission cars, not only to save the spanish automotive sector which is one of the most importants in the country, but to ensure that the future generations have a planet where to drive their cars too.</strong></p> <p><em>The full analysis and the code used can be found in this</em> <a href="https://github.com/anrodon/spanish-vehicle-registrations-analysis/tree/main"><em>Github Repo</em></a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="data-science"/><category term="cars"/><category term="cars"/><category term="Spain"/><category term="data"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the last 12 months of car registrations in Spain tell us about its path to a zero-emissions car park]]></summary></entry></feed>
