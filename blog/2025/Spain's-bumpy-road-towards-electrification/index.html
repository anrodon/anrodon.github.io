New propulsion systems, regulations, consumer demands, and other factors are challenging the status quo of this century-old industry.</p> <p>According to the European Commission, <strong>passenger cars are responsible for around 16% of the total CO2 emissions in Europe</strong>, and because of that, the European administration has set <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/transport/road-transport-reducing-co2-emissions-vehicles/co2-emission-performance-standards-cars-and-vans_en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fleet-wide CO2 emission targets</a> to contribute to reaching at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990 as well as achieving climate neutrality by 2050, in line with the <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-climate-law_en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">European Climate Law</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spain is the second largest passenger car producer in Europe</strong> (behind Germany) and the automotive industry generates approximately the 7% of the Spanish GDP. But Spain is not only a major automobile producer; it is also a significant consumer market for cars, with <strong>yearly registration figures close to 1 million vehicles</strong>.</p> <p>The Spanish General Traffic Administration (<a href="https://www.dgt.es/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DGT — Dirección General de Tráfico</a>) has an Open Data portal called <a href="https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DGT en Cifras</a>, which allow everyone to download various data related to car registrations, drivers, fines, and other interesting topics related to the spanish car park.</p> <p>I was curious about analyzing one of its datasets storing microdata of the registered cars for each month (<a href="https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/dgt-en-cifras-resultados/dgt-en-cifras-detalle/Microdatos-de-parque-de-vehiculos-anual/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Microdatos de Matriculaciones de Vehículos (mensual)</a>) and the results of this analysis show a really sad reality: <strong>the spanish market is not choosing to purchase zero-emissions vehicles</strong>.</p> <p>Before starting to work with the data, I wrote four questions to guide my analysis:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Are the Spanish costumers purchasing electrified vehicles?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which Spanish provinces have the biggest and smallest number of electrified vehicles registrations?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which Spanish provinces are registering more and fewer polluting vehicles?</strong></li> <li><strong>Which car brands are selling more and fewer ecological cars in Spain?</strong></li> </ol> <p>These questions were written with the aim of assessing if the spanish car consumers are taking or not into account the CO2 emissions when purchasing a new car. Because of that, we only took into account new passenger cars from the dataset (we did not include commercial vehicles, vans, industrial machinery, etc and neither used cars being registered again).</p> <p><strong>The data used has been from March 2024 to February 2025 (last 12 available months of data).</strong></p> <p>In regards of the first question the situation is the following:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Even though <strong>HEV cars</strong> (Hybrid Electric Vehicles — gas cars with electric motor support) <strong>are the ones being registered the most</strong>, <strong>PHEV</strong> (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) <strong>and BEV</strong> (Battery Electric Vehicles) <strong>together account for only 11.3% of the registrations, with only 6.1% being fully electric</strong>. This indicates that Spain still has a long way to go to reach zero-emission registrations.</p> <p>With the second question, <strong>“Which Spanish provinces have the highest and lowest number of electrified vehicle registrations?”</strong>, I tried to delve deeper into the dataset.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>With the graphic above, I saw that the capital <strong>Madrid is the clear winner in terms of zero-emissions vehicle registrations</strong>, followed by big cities like Barcelona or Valencia.

We see that <strong>most of the PHEV and BEV cars registered by companies in Madrid are for Renting</strong> (probably because most of the banks and renting companies in Spain are registered in Madrid), so <strong>close to half of the PHEV and BEV cars registered in Madrid are probably to be driven by renting customers in other areas of Spain</strong>.</p> <p>So, we have an answer for our second question as we know that <strong>Madrid is the province registering more electrified cars, but the customer behind the wheel may not be driving it in the capital</strong>.</p> <p>To complement this half answered question, I made a ratio of cars per habitant of each of the top 5 provinces registering more PHEV and BEV only by natural persons.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Top 5 provinces with more PHEV + BEV car registrations by natural persons</figcaption> </figure> <p>We can see that <strong>Madrid and Valencia are the leaders in terms of electrified vehicles per capita</strong> and Barcelona, Alicante and Malaga have similar numbers but are a slightly behind. Would be interesting to analize what is driving this behaviour in Madrid and Valencia to be able to implement measures to improve the rates in the other provinces.</p> <p>To answer the third question, “<strong>Which spanish provinces are registering more and less polluting vehicles?”</strong>, I used the field in the dataset that indicates the g Co2/km of each car to have an average for each province.</p> <p>Doing a quick average between all the cars registered, I found that <strong>the average of CO2 emissions for cars registered in Spain for the last 12 months have been 123,09 g Co2/km</strong>.</p> <p><strong>This number is really alarming as the EU Commission target was 95 g Co2/km for 2024 and is 93,6 g Co2/km for 2025 to 2029.</strong></p> <p>To get a bit of feeling of how bad the situation is, I wanted to see the average CO2 emissions of the top 15 sold models.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-50" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Top 15 car models by volume (BASTIDOR_ITV) with its average CO2 emmissions</figcaption> </figure> <p>We see that <strong>for the 15 models with more registrations in the last 12 months, only the TOYOTA C-HR has an average g CO2 /km value inside the EU Comission Targets.</strong></p> <p>Now focusing on the provinces, I took the company registered vehicles apart from the analysis to not contaminate the big picture, and printed the average emissions by province.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Bad news again. <strong>Not even one of the provinces in Spain is achieving the average emission targets of the EU Commission for the new cars registered</strong>, but the accumulated fleet-wide average will be worse!</p> <p>Let’s see it even more graphically:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2025-04-07-Spain's-bumpy-road-towards-electrification/fig9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 d-block mx-auto w-75" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>In the map above, <strong>the scale is set so all the provinces below the EU Commission targets should be shown in white, and more red as they pass the 95 g CO2/km figure</strong>.

Most of them share proudly the vision of a future for the automotive industry with only zero-emissions vehicles, have invested lots of money into developing this kind of cars and spend a lot into advertising of their electric models.</p> <p><strong>What this analysis shows is that the market in Spain is not choosing the electromobility options that the brands offer, and this is something that the spanish administrations should be really worried about.</strong></p> <p><strong>It is urgent that the spanish market has the right incentives to buy zero-emission cars, not only to save the spanish automotive sector which is one of the most importants in the country, but to ensure that the future generations have a planet where to drive their cars too.</strong></p> <p><em>The full analysis and the code used can be found in this</em> <a href="https://github.com/anrodon/spanish-vehicle-registrations-analysis/tree/main" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Github Repo</em></a>.</p> </div> </article> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 930px; margin: 0 auto;"> <br> <script defer src="/assets/js/giscus-setup.js"></script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="https://github.com/anrodon" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/anrodon" title="Kaggle" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-kaggle"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreurodriguezdonaire" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Andreu Rodríguez Donaire. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
